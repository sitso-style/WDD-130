                The image slider contains images of available rivers on our site.
                Click the navigation circles to change between them and click a specific one.
                The names of the rivers are <em>Grand Canyon, Arizona, Salmon River in idaho, Grand Canyon in Arizona</em>
                If you want more information about those rivers thay are below!
            </p>

      <em>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</em>
      <p>
        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
        living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
        with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river 
        and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. 
        The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa 
        pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and 
        provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV.
        The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. 
        As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
        early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are
        good rapids all sum...but families with children who like to swim tend 
        to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
      </p>
      <em>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</em>
      <p>
        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
        the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
        beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
        from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
        interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
        
        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
      </p>
      <em>Grand Canyon, Arizona</em>
      <p>
        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
        You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
        scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled 
        not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, 
        but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
        The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) 
        to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, 
        so we often refer to both.
